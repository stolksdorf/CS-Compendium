# Computer Science Compendium

I created this document as a way to solidify my CS fundementals, study for technical interviews, as well as practice LaTeX. My goal was to greatly simplify and classify the information; Providing common use cases, memorable diagrams, easy-to-folow pseudocode, and Big-O notation. The bulk of my research comes from [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) and [Cracking The Code Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/), and I refernce the page number in the column when possible.

I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. Enjoy!
